# Algorithms-for-Information-Retrieval
Programs written as a part of the course Algorithms for Information Retrieval

The codes contained in this repository demonstrates the working of a simple information retrieval system

The Lab1_Lab2 file deals with cleaning of the dataset and applying simple pre-processing steps like stemming and lematization
After this step, inverted indices of the words in the loaded corpus are created.

Lab 3 continues the work done in Lab1 and Lab2. This file deals with the retrieval of relevant documents based on the binary queries iof the form:

* Query_subpart 1 AND Query_subpart-2
* Query_subpart 1 OR Query_subpart-2

The Query_subparts can optionally include the NOT operation as well.
Relevant documents which satisfy the query are returned.

Lab 4 deviates from the continuum of the previous 3 labs as it deals with the retrieval speeds of the datastructures:

* A Binary Tree
* Hash Table

The Assignment file is a combination of the first three labs.
